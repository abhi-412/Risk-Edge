However, many in the industry are still unaware of various AI Use Cases that can be adopted possible within their own company.",

            p2:"The attribution can give a clear picture of which fundamental factors have impacted the P&L positively or negatively and by how much – and the analysis can be done for any time period. The results can then be checked against trader’s views on each of those fundamental factors before they built / changed the portfolio to its current shape. It not only acts as a check for the traders, but also as a feed-forward mechanism for the teams who can see clear patterns emerging in the underlying fundamentals and their calls on those fundamental factors.",

You’d want to see red flags on these and other such cases much before it actually hits the reality, right? But today’s systems and processes are just about geared towards generating either pure Bayesian framework based or pure score-card based models that fail to take into account several external factors that often play a large role in predicting these red flags.",
